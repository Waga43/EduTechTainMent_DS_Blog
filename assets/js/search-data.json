Introduction . This python code was inspired by my repeated failure to access links shared on Twitter. I have had to use alternative methods to expose the main/destination links pointed to by the Twitter shortened URLs. Have you ever experienced same? Perhaps the picture below will give more context. . . Skills you will use/learn to use . The following code challenge will enable you to practice: . Use of requests library to send HTTP requests. | Use of regular expressions. | Use python to interact with the clipboard. | Use of Python if-else, and try-except statements to control program flow | Task Description . Create a Python Code to do the following: . Check if the shortened URL expander website is live. | Use the pyperclip module to interact with the clipboard. | If there is no link on the clipboard, prompt the user to type a shortened Twitter URL. | Ensure checks using the re module to ensure only Twitter shortened links with t.co is accepted. | Give the program only two attempts before exiting. | Use the webbrowser module to automatically open the full link. | Install requirements . import requests # For sending http requests via python import re # To help match or find strings or sets of strings import webbrowser # To open a web broswer by default import pyperclip # To interact with the clipboard . . Twitter Shortened Link We shall be using for this Project . collapse-hide . https://t.co/UQK0XEf4G9 . The shortened URL expander link is live. You can proceed! Please type the short_url you want to open: &gt;&gt;&gt; https://t.co/UQK0XEf4G9 ✅ Valid input!!. Let&#39;s proceed to the site! ✅ . True . `https://t.co/UQK0XEf4G9` . . . Warning: Disclosure About the Codes . Skills not Covered . . Important: Please note the following: Reading this code, we can easily see how long the code is and that there is some degree of repetitive coding. . I intentionally left out the use of while statements and functions. Using them would have made the code more intuitive. Using these will make our codes better. . Not to worry though, its a learning process. we shall fine tune this code next time to see how best we can improve the code. There is so much more we can do with this. We just have to be imaginative. For example, we can write a python script extract the exact destination address of the Twitter shortened links using Web Scraping. Aren&#39;t you excited to learn about this? I am !!! . The codes are written this way to ensure beginners to Python programming will understand some fundamental important concepts before diving deeper. . . Tip: You can go ahead and try out re-writing this code using Python function and while statements. You can share your comments on here or on Twitter. . 💻 Python EduTechTainMent 1- Write a Python program to Automatically Open Twitter shortened Links&quot;⌨ Let&#39;s learn Coding by Coding 🖥 . &mdash; EduTechTainMent (@EduTech_TM) August 5, 2022 . .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
